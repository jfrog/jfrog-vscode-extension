## About this Extension
The cost of remediating a vulnerability is akin to the cost of fixing a bug.
The earlier you remediate a vulnerability in the release cycle, the lower the cost.
The extension allows developers to find and fix security vulnerabilities in their projects and to see valuable information
about the status of their code by continuously scanning it locally with [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/).

### What security capabilities do we provide?
####  Basic
##### üì¶ Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Scan project dependencies for security issues
- Access enriched CVE data provided by the JFrog Security Research team.

Learn more about enriched CVEs in the [JFrog Security CVE Research and Enrichment](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/JFrog+Security+CVE+Research+and+Enrichment) documentation.

####  Advanced
*Requires Xray version 3.66.5 or above and Enterprise X / Enterprise+ subscription with Advanced DevSecOps.*

##### üîç Vulnerability Contextual Analysis
This feature uses the code context to eliminate false positive reports on vulnerable dependencies that are not applicable to the code. Vulnerability Contextual Analysis is currently supported for Python and JavaScript code.

##### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scan
- Analyze Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files, such as Terraform, to identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before deploying your cloud infrastructure.
- Get actionable insights and recommendations for securing your IaC configurations.

##### üîê Secrets Detection

#### üåü Additional Perks
* Security issues are easily visible inline.
* The results show issues with context, impact, and remediation.
* View all security issues in one place, in the JFrog tab.
* For Security issues with an available fixed version, you can upgrade to the fixed version within the plugin.
* Track the status of the code while it is being built, tested, and scanned on the CI server.

The extension also applies [JFrog File Spec JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli/master/schema/filespec-schema.json) on the following file patterns: `**/filespecs/*.json`, `*filespec*.json` and `*.filespec`. Read more about JFrog File specs [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/FileSpec).

## Getting Started

1. [Install the **JFrog** extension in VS Code](#install-the-jfrog-extension-in-vs-code)
2. [Connect VS Code to Your JFrog Environment](#connecting-vs-code-to-your-jfrog-environment)
3. [Start using the extension](#using-the-extension)


## Install the **JFrog** extension in VS Code

The extension is available to install from the VS Code extensions marketplace. after installing the JFrog extension tab <img src="resources/extensionIcon.png" width="30"> will appear in the activity bar
![Install](resources/readme/preview/install.png)

## Connecting VS Code to Your JFrog Environment

<details>
<summary>If you don't have a JFrog Platform instance, create a free instance in the cloud by running one of the following commands in your terminal.</summary>

**MacOS and Linux using cUrl**

```
curl -fL "https://getcli.jfrog.io?setup" | sh
```

**Windows using PowerShell**

```
powershell "Start-Process -Wait -Verb RunAs powershell '-NoProfile iwr https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/v2-jf/[RELEASE]/jfrog-cli-windows-amd64/jf.exe -OutFile $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\jf.exe'" ; jf setup
```
The commands will do the following:

1. Install JFrog CLI on your machine.
2. Create a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud for you.
3. Configure VS Code to connect to your new environment.
</details>
<br>

Connect VS Code to your JFrog Platform instance by clicking on the green Connect ![Connect](resources/readme/connect.png) button or the provided button in the JFrog extension tab:
![Connect](resources/readme/preview/connect.png)

You can choose one of the following methods to provide VS Code with the JFrog Platform connections details.

### Use the JFrog CLI Credentials

If JFrog CLI is installed on your machibe, and is configured with the JFrog Platform's connection details, use those details to connect VS Code to the JFrog Platform.

### Enter Connection

Enter your JFrog platform connection details manually.

**Note**: You can leave the JFrog Platform URL empty, to enter the URLs of Artifactory and Xray separately.

### Environment Variables

You may set the connection details using the following environment variables. VS Code will read them after it is launched.

-   `JFROG_IDE_URL` - JFrog URL
-   `JFROG_IDE_USERNAME` - JFrog username
-   `JFROG_IDE_PASSWORD` - JFrog password
-   `JFROG_IDE_ACCESS_TOKEN` - JFrog access token
-   `JFROG_IDE_STORE_CONNECTION` - Set the value of this environment variable to **true**, if you'd like VS Code to store the connection details after reading them from the environment variables.

**Note**: For security reasons, it is recommended to unset the environment variables after launching VS Code.

## Using the Extension

The extension offers two modes, **Local** and **CI**.
The two modes can be toggled by pressing on their respective buttons that will appear next to the components tree.

-   The **Local** view displays information about the local code as it is being developed in VS Code. The developer can scan their local workspace continuously. The information is displayed in the **Local** view.
-   The **CI** view allows the tracking of the code as it is built, tested and scanned by the CI server. It displays information about the status of the build and includes a link to the build log on the CI server.

### Severity Icons
The icon demonstrates the top severity issue of a selected component and its transitive dependencies. The following table describes the severities from highest to lowest:

| Icon                                                          | Severity  | Description                      |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------:|
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/Critical.png" width="20">  |  Critical |   Issue with critical severity   |
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/High.png" width="20">  |  High  |   Issue with high severity   |
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/Medium.png" width="20">  |  Medium  |   Issue with medium severity   |
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/Low.png" width="20">  |  Low  |   Issue with low severity   |
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/Unknown.png" width="20">  |  Unknown  |   Issue with unknown severity   |
| <img src="resources/readme/severities/notApplicableUnknown.png" height="15" width="15"><img src="resources/readme/severities/notApplicableLow.png" height="15" width="15"><img src="resources/readme/severities/notApplicableMedium.png" height="15" width="15"><img src="resources/readme/severities/notApplicableHigh.png" height="15" width="15"><img src="resources/readme/severities/notApplicableCritical.png" height="15" width="15"> |  Not Applicable  |   CVE issue that is not applicable to your source code   |
| <img src="./resources/Normal.png" width="20">  |  Normal  |   No issues (Used only in CI view)   |

## The Local View

The local view of the extension adds JFrog Xray scanning of project dependencies and source code to your VS Code IDE.
It allows developers to view panels displaying vulnerability information about their dependencies and source code in their VS Code IDE.
With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organization‚Äôs product.

### Scanning workspace
scan your workspace by clicking the Scan/Rescan button, the <img src='resources/dark/refresh.png' height="15" width="15"> icon at the extension tab or click on Start Xray Scan from within the editor. The scan will create a list of files with vulnerabilities in the workspace.
![Refresh](resources/readme/preview/refresh.png)

### Viewing Vulnerabilities
The JFrog extension incorporates a file tree displaying all the vulnerabilities within the project. Each file that is infected with a vulnerability appears as a tree node.

Descriptor file (e.g., pom.xml in Maven, go.mod in Go, etc.) has a special meaning that outlines the available direct dependencies for the project. The tree will show these descriptor files containing vulnerable dependencies.  In cases where a direct dependency contains vulnerable child dependencies, the tree will show the vulnerable child dependencies instead, denoting them with a '(indirect)' postfix.

Furthermore, various types of vulnerability nodes, such as Contextual Analysis Vulnerabilities or hard-coded secrets, may be present in other source code files.

Each file node in the tree is interactive,  click and expand it to view its children node and navigate to the corresponding file in the IDE for better visibility. Upon navigating to a file, the extension will highlight the vulnerable line, making it easier to locate the specific issue

In addition the locations with vulnerabilities will be marked in the editor. By clicking on the light bulb icon next to a vulnerable location in the editor, we can instantly jump to the corresponding entry in the tree view.

![Tree view](resources/readme/preview/treeView.png)

Clicking on a CVE in the list will open the location with the issue in the editor and a vulnerability details view. This view contains information about the vulnerability, the vulnerable component, fixed versions, impact paths and much more.

### Creating Ignore Rules
When Xray watches are enabled and a vulnerability is detected, a closed eye icon will appear next to the vulnerability line in the JFrog extension. By clicking on this icon, you can initiate the process of creating an [Ignore Rule](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Ignore+Rules) in Xray.
![Ignore_Rule](resources/readme/preview/ignoreRule.png)

## Behind the Scenes
### Go Projects
Behind the scenes, the JFrog VS Code Extension scans all the project dependencies, both direct and indirect (transitive), even if they are not declared in the project's go.mod. It builds the Go dependencies tree by running `go mod graph` and intersecting the results with `go list -f '{{with .Module}}{{.Path}} {{.Version}}{{end}}' all` command. Therefore, please make sure to have Go CLI in your system PATH.

### Maven Projects
The JFrog VS Code Extension builds the Maven dependencies tree by running `mvn dependency:tree`. View licenses and top issue severities directly from the pom.xml.

Important notes:

1. To have your project dependencies scanned by JFrog Xray, make sure Maven is installed, and that the mvn command is in your system PATH.
2. For projects which include the [Maven Dependency Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/examples/resolving-conflicts-using-the-dependency-tree.html) as a build plugin, with include or exclude configurations, the scanning functionality is disabled. For example:

```xml
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
            <includes>org.apache.*</includes>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
```

### Npm Projects

Behind the scenes, the extension builds the npm dependencies tree by running `npm list`. View licenses and top issue severities directly from the package.json.

Important:
To have your project dependencies scanned by JFrog Xray, make sure the npm CLI is installed on your local machine and that it is in your system PATH.
In addition, the project dependencies must be installed using `npm install`.

### Exclude Development Dependencies During Scan

Development dependencies are scanned by default. You can exclude them by choosing `Exclude Dev Dependencies` in the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings). Currently, only npm is supported.

### Yarn v1 Projects

Behind the scenes, the extension builds the Yarn dependencies tree by running `yarn list`. View licenses and top issue severities directly from the yarn.lock.

Important:

-   To have your project dependencies scanned by JFrog Xray, make sure the Yarn CLI is installed on your local machine and that it is in your system PATH.
-   Yarn v2 is not yet supported.

### Pypi Projects

Behind the scenes, the extension builds the Pypi dependencies tree by running `pipdeptree` on your Python virtual environment. It also uses the Python interpreter path configured by the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). View licenses and top issue severities directly from your requirements.txt files. The scan your Pypi dependencies, make sure the following requirements are met:

1. The [Python extension for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_install-visual-studio-code-and-the-python-extension) is installed.
2. Depending on your project, Please make sure Python 2 or 3 are included in your system PATH.
3. Create and activate a virtual env as instructed in [VS-Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_global-virtual-and-conda-environments). Make sure that Virtualenv Python interpreter is selected as instructed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment).
4. Open a new terminal and activate your Virtualenv:

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```sh
        source <venv-dir>/bin/activate

        # For example:
        source .env/bin/activate
        ```

    - On Windows:

        ```powershell
        .\<venv-dir>\Scripts\activate

        # For example:
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

5. In the same terminal, install your python project and dependencies according to your project specifications.

### .NET Projects

For .NET projects which use NuGet packages as dependencies, the extension displays the NuGet dependencies tree, together with the information for each dependency.
Behind the scenes, the extension builds the NuGet dependencies tree using the [NuGet deps tree](https://github.com/jfrog/nuget-deps-tree) npm package.

Important:

-   Does your project define its NuGet dependencies using a _packages.config_ file? If so, then please make sure the `nuget` CLI is installed on your local machine and that it is in your system PATH. The extension uses the `nuget` CLI to find the location of the NuGet packages on the local file-system.
-   The project must be restored using `nuget restore` or `dotnet restore` prior to scanning. After this action, you should click on the Refresh ![Refresh](resources/readme/refresh.png) button, for the tree view to be refreshed and updated.

## The CI View

The CI view of the extension allows you to view information about your builds directly from your CI system. This allows developers to keep track of the status of their code, while it is being built, tested and scanned as part of the CI pipeline, regardless of the CI provider used.

This information can be viewed inside JFrog VS Code Extension, from the JFrog Panel, after switching to CI mode.

The following details can be made available in the CI view.

-   Status of the build run (passed or failed)
-   Build run start time
-   Git branch and latest commit message
-   Link to the CI run log
-   Security information about the build artifacts and dependencies

### How Does It Work?

The CI information displayed in VS Code is pulled by the JFrog Extension directly from JFrog Artifactory. This information is stored in Artifactory as part of the build-info, which is published to Artifactory by the CI server.

Read more about build-info in the [Build Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Build+Integration) documentation page. If the CI pipeline is also configured to scan the build-info by JFrog Xray, the JFrog VS Code Extension will pull the results of the scan from JFrog Xray and display them in the CI view as well.

### Setting Up Your CI Pipeline

Before VS Code can display information from your CI in the CI View, your CI pipeline needs to be configured to expose this data.
Read [this guide](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Setting+Up+CI+Integration) which describes how to configure your CI pipeline.

### Setting Up the CI View

Set your CI build name in the Build name pattern field at the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings). This is the name of the build published to Artifactory by your CI pipeline. You have the option of setting \* to view all the builds published to Artifactory.

After your builds were fetched from Artifactory, press on the Builds ![Builds](resources/light/build.png) button to choose what build to display.

![CI](resources/readme/gifs/ci.gif)

## Extension Settings

To open the extension settings, use the extension settings icon:
![Open_Settings](resources/readme/preview/openSettings.png)
Or use the following VS Code menu command:

-   On Windows/Linux - File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > JFrog
-   On macOS - Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > JFrog

### Apply Xray Policies to your Projects

You can configure the JFrog VS-Code extension  to use the security policies you create in Xray. Policies enable you to create a set of rules, in which each rule defines security criteria, with a corresponding set of automatic actions according to your needs. Policies are enforced when applying them to Watches.

If you'd like to use a JFrog Project that is associated with the policy, follow these steps:

1. Create a [JFrog Project](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Projects), or obtain the relevant JFrog Project key.
1. Create a [Policy](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules) on JFrog Xray.
1. Create a [Watch](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray+Watches) on JFrog Xray and assign your Policy and Project as resources to it.
1. Configure your Project key in the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings).

If however your policies are referenced through an Xray Watch or Watches, follow these steps instead:

1. Create one or more [Watches](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Xray+Watches) on JFrog Xray.
1. Configure your Watches in the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings).

### Exclude Paths from Scan

By default, paths containing the words `test`, `venv` and `node_modules` are excluded from Xray scan.
The exclude pattern can be configured in the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings).

### Proxy Configuration

If your JFrog environment is behind an HTTP/S proxy, follow these steps to configure the proxy server:

1. Go to Preferences --> Settings --> Application --> Proxy
1. Set the proxy URL under 'Proxy'.
1. Make sure 'Proxy Support' is 'override' or 'on'.

-   Alternatively, you can use the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.

### Proxy Authorization

If your proxy server requires credentials, follow these steps:

1. Follow 1-3 steps under [Proxy configuration](#proxy-configuration).

#### Basic authorization

1. Encode with base64: `[Username]:[Password]`.
1. Under 'Proxy Authorization' click on 'Edit in settings.json'.
1. Add to settings.json:

-   `"http.proxyAuthorization": "Basic [Encoded credentials]"`.

#### Access token authorization

1. Under 'Proxy Authorization' click on 'Edit in settings.json'.
1. Add to settings.json:

-   `"http.proxyAuthorization": "Bearer [Access token]"`.

#### Example

-   `Username: foo`
-   `Password: bar`

settings.json:

```json
{
    "http.proxyAuthorization": "Basic Zm9vOmJhcg=="
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Change the log level to 'debug', 'info', 'warn', or 'err' in the [Extension Settings](#extension-settings).
