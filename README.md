[![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/JFrog.jfrog-vscode-extension.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JFrog.jfrog-vscode-extension)

## General

The cost of remediating a vulnerability is akin to the cost of fixing a bug.
The earlier you remediate a vulnerability in the release cycle, the lower the cost.
JFrog Xray is instrumental in flagging components when vulnerabilities are discovered in production systems at runtime,
or even sooner, during the development.

The JFrog VS Code Extension adds JFrog Xray scanning of npm project dependencies to your VS Code IDE.
It allows developers to view panels displaying vulnerability information about the components and their dependencies directly in their VS Code IDE.
With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organizationâ€™s product.

## Using JFrog Visual Studio Code Extension

Connect to JFrog Xray by clicking on the green Connect ![Connect](resources/readme/connect.png) button:
![Connect](resources/readme/gifs/connect.gif)

View the project's dependency tree:
![Open_Extension](resources/readme/gifs/open.gif)

The JFrog extension automatically triggers a scan of the project's npm dependencies whenever a change in the **package-lock.json** file is detected.
To invoke a scan manually, click on the Refresh ![Refresh](resources/readme/refresh.png) button or click on *Start Xray Scan* from within the **package.json** (above the *dependencies* section):
![Refresh](resources/readme/gifs/refresh.gif)

View existing issues
![Vulnerabilities](resources/readme/gifs/show_vulnerabilities.gif)

View licenses directly from within the **package.json**:
![License](resources/readme/gifs/license.gif)

View additional information about a dependency:
![Show_In_Deps_Tree](resources/readme/gifs/show_deps.gif)

View dependency in package.json:
![Show_In_Pkg_Json](resources/readme/gifs/show_in_pkg_json.gif)

Search in tree:
![Search_In_Tree](resources/readme/gifs/search.gif)

To filter scan results, click on the Filter ![Filter](resources/readme/filter.png) button:

### Proxy configuration

If your JFrog Xray instance is behind an HTTP/S proxy, follow these steps to configure the proxy server:

1. Go to Preferences --> Settings --> Application --> Proxy
1. Set the proxy URL under 'Proxy'.
1. Make sure 'Proxy Support' is 'override' or 'on'.

- Alternatively, you can use the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.

#### Proxy Authorization

If your proxy server requires credentials, follow these steps:

1. Follow 1-3 steps under [Proxy configuration](#proxy-configuration).
1. Encode with base64: `[Username]:[Password]`.
1. Under 'Proxy Authorization' click on 'Edit in settings.json'.
1. Add to settings.json: `"http.proxyAuthorization": "Basic [Encoded credentials]"`.

##### Example

- `Username: foo`
- `Password: bar`

settings.json:

```json
{
   "http.proxyAuthorization": "Basic Zm9vOmJhcg=="
}
```
